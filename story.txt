A medieval castle (Eltz) has the best bakery (Baeckerei) in Berlin.
The most wettbewerbs (competetive) beer drinkers gather in Biergarten (beer garden) to show off their skills.
Every Hund in Berlin loves the smell of Bratwurst coming from the Bratwurst coming from Hauptstrasse.
I went on vacation in German and landed at Berlin  Flughafen.
Then I rented a car from BMW dealership over the Hauptstrasse.
This was the finest BMW I had ever driven, the Klimaalange is perfect and the audio system was meant for Rammstein.
