A schloss (castle) has the best bakery (Baeckerei) in Berlin.
The most wettbewerbs (competetive) beer drinkers gather in the Biergarten (beer garden) to show off their skills.
Every Hund (dog) in Berlin loves the smell of Bratwurst (sausage) coming from the Hauptstrasse (main road).
The waitstaff are faehig (capable) enough to deftly move through a crowded Ratskeller (basement restaraunt), even in a Dirndel (traditional German dress)!
I went on vacation in German and landed at Berlin  Flughafen.
Then I rented a car from BMW dealership over the Hauptstrasse.
I then drove the car with the Klimaanlage on and enjoyed the scenery.
This was the finest BMW I had ever driven, the Klimaalange is perfect and the audio system was meant for Rammstein.
While driving the BMW, the scent of freshly baked apfelkuchen and other gebaeck at a nearby baeckere was too enticing to pass by.
I like driving BMW. and I like vaction by driving
I drove to the baeckerei(bakery) and bought an apfelkuchen(apple cake).
I ate it in an schloss while wearing a lederhose.
A hund came to ask for some apfelkuchen while hopping on my Lederhose.
