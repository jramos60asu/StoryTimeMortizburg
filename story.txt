A medieval castle (Eltz) has the best bakery (Baeckerei) in Berlin.
The most wettbewerbs (competetive) beer drinkers gather in Biergarten (beer garden) to show off their skills.
Every Hund in Berlin loves the smell of Bratwurst coming from the Bratwurst coming from Hauptstrasse.
I went on vacation in German and landed at Berlin  Flughafen.
Then I rented a car from BMW dealership over the Hauptstrasse.
While driving the BMW, the scent of freshly baked apfelkuchen and other gebaeck at a nearby baeckere was too enticing to pass by.
I drove to the baeckerei(bakery) and bought an apfelkuchen(apple cake).
I ate it in an Eltz while wearing a lederhose.
